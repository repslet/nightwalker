**Hack to "fix" theme after qBittorrent WebUI stopped support for translation in v4.5. NOTE: Not optimised, just a splice of the current WebUI and the nightwalker styles**

# Installation

### Clone this repo (Windows)
1. Clone or download this repo as a .ZIP
2. Move it somewhere where qBittorrent can find it.

### Clone this repo (Linux)
1. `cd /opt`
2. `sudo git clone https://github.com/CallMeBruce/nightwalker`
3. `sudo chmod -R 777 nightwalker`

### Activate Alterative WebUI in qBittorrent
1. Under `Tools->Preferences->WebUI` enable `Use alternative WebUI`.
2. Choose a location that points to the `Nightwalker` folder, i.e. `/opt/nightwalker`
3. Restart qBittorrent or refresh your browser for changes to take effect.

You can also change these settings via the config file. The relevant entries are:

- WebUI\AlternativeUIEnabled=true
- WebUI\RootFolder=/path/to/Nightwalker

### Update theme (Linux)
1. `cd /opt/nightwalker`
2. `git checkout main`
3. `git fetch origin main`
4. `git reset --hard origin/main`

### Tested
Based on the standard qBittorrent WebUI theme (4.5 release).

#### A note for those who used the [Theme Park][theme.park] nginx mod
Modify your nginx config and remove the lines that introduced the external css, anything after `rewrite ^/qbittorrent/(.*) /$1 break; ` (non inclusive) is something that can be removed. Do not leave -modded, or any other files that are not necessary for nginx to function in the `/etc/nginx/apps/` directory. Reload nginx after making changes by doing `sudo service nginx configtest`, if it returns OK, then proceed and do `sudo service nginx reload`.
